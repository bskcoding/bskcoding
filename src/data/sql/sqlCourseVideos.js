    description:
      "SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the standard language used to communicate with relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. With SQL you can store, retrieve, update and delete data. A database is an organized collection of data stored in tables. Each table has rows (records) and columns (fields). For example, an Employees table may have columns like id, name, salary and dept. SQL is divided into five main sub-languages: DDL (Data Definition Language) for defining structure, DML (Data Manipulation Language) for working with data, DQL (Data Query Language) for reading data, TCL (Transaction Control Language) for transactions, and DCL (Data Control Language) for permissions.",

    title: "Installing SQL - Day 2",
    description:
      "Before writing SQL queries, you need a database to run them on. The most common free options for beginners are MySQL Community Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server Express. To install MySQL on Windows, download the MySQL Installer from the official website, choose the Developer Default setup type, set a root password during configuration, and finish the installation. After installing, you can connect using the MySQL Command Line Client, MySQL Workbench (a graphical IDE), or any client like DBeaver. A database is simply a folder/namespace that holds related tables, schemas, views and stored procedures. Create your first database with: CREATE DATABASE bskdb; Then switch into it with: USE bskdb;",

      "SQL statements are the commands you send to the database. The most important categories are: DDL statements (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME) that change the database structure; DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) that change the data inside tables; DQL statements (SELECT) that read data; TCL statements (COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT) that manage transactions; and DCL statements (GRANT, REVOKE) that handle user permissions. Every SQL statement ends with a semicolon (;). Statements are case-insensitive for keywords, but data inside strings is case-sensitive. Comments can be written using -- for single line or /* ... */ for multi-line.",

    title: "SQL Operators - Day 4",
    description:
      "SQL operators are symbols used in WHERE clauses to perform comparisons and logical operations. Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) work on numeric values. Comparison operators (=, <> or !=, >, <, >=, <=) check conditions between values. Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) combine multiple conditions. Examples: SELECT * FROM emp WHERE salary > 30000 AND dept = 'IT'; SELECT * FROM emp WHERE dept = 'HR' OR dept = 'Finance'; SELECT * FROM emp WHERE NOT dept = 'Sales';. You can also use BETWEEN for ranges, IN for lists, LIKE for pattern matching, and IS NULL to check for missing values. Use parentheses () to control the order of evaluation.",

      "Special operators handle advanced filtering scenarios. IN checks if a value matches any value in a list: WHERE deptno IN (10, 20, 30). NOT IN excludes those values. BETWEEN checks if a value lies within an inclusive range: WHERE salary BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000. NOT BETWEEN excludes that range. LIKE performs pattern matching using two wildcards: % matches zero or more characters, _ matches exactly one character. Example: WHERE ename LIKE 'S%' (starts with S), WHERE ename LIKE '%A%' (contains A), WHERE ename LIKE '_A%' (A is the second character). IS NULL finds rows where a column has no value. IS NOT NULL finds rows with values.",

They fall into two main categories: Single Row Functions (work on each row individually and return one result per row, e.g. UPPER, LOWER, LENGTH, ROUND) and Aggregate / Group Functions (work on a set of rows and return one summary value, e.g. SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, COUNT). Functions can also be classified by the data type they operate on: Character functions (UPPER, LOWER, SUBSTR, LENGTH), Numeric functions (ROUND, TRUNC, MOD, ABS), Date functions (SYSDATE, MONTHS_BETWEEN, ADD_MONTHS), and Conversion functions (TO_CHAR, TO_DATE, TO_NUMBER).",

Example: SELECT deptno, COUNT(*) AS total_employees, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM emp GROUP BY deptno; This shows the number of employees and average salary for each department. Important rules: 1) Every column in the SELECT list that is NOT inside an aggregate function must appear in the GROUP BY clause. 2) WHERE filters rows BEFORE grouping. 3) You can group by multiple columns: GROUP BY deptno, job to get subtotals per job within each department. 4) Aliases cannot be used in GROUP BY in most databases - use the real column name.",

Example: SELECT deptno, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal FROM emp GROUP BY deptno HAVING AVG(salary) > 40000; This shows only departments whose average salary exceeds 40000. Execution order in SQL: FROM -> WHERE -> GROUP BY -> HAVING -> SELECT -> ORDER BY. So WHERE filters individual rows, HAVING filters whole groups. You can use HAVING with or without GROUP BY. Without GROUP BY, HAVING treats the entire table as one group and applies to aggregate functions across all rows. Common use: SELECT job, COUNT(*) FROM emp GROUP BY job HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;.",

      "A subquery is a query written inside another SQL query. The inner query runs first and its result is passed to the outer query. Subqueries are written inside parentheses. Example: SELECT * FROM emp WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp); - this finds employees earning more than the company's average. Subqueries can return: 1) A single value (scalar) used with =, >, < operators. 2) One column with multiple rows used with IN, ANY, ALL. 3) A full table used in FROM clause (inline view). The inner query can read tables that the outer query uses; the outer query cannot reference column aliases from the inner query. Subqueries make complex problems easier to solve step by step.",

Another example: SELECT name FROM emp WHERE deptno = (SELECT deptno FROM dept WHERE dname = 'RESEARCH');. You can also use a subquery to compare across tables: find employees who earn more than the average salary of their own department - SELECT * FROM emp e WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp WHERE deptno = e.deptno); This is called a correlated subquery because the inner query references the outer query's column e.deptno.",

      "Escape characters are used inside a LIKE pattern to match the wildcard characters % and _ literally. By default % means 'any sequence' and _ means 'any single character'. To search for an employee whose name actually contains '%' or '_', use the ESCAPE clause. Example: SELECT * FROM emp WHERE ename LIKE '%\\%%' ESCAPE '\\'; - this finds names containing the literal percent sign. SELECT * FROM emp WHERE ename LIKE '%\\_%' ESCAPE '\\'; - finds names containing underscore. The character after ESCAPE becomes the escape character; whatever follows it is treated as a literal symbol. Useful in real-world data that contains special symbols like %, _, [, ], ^, etc.",

Operators: IN checks equality against any value in the list; ANY compares with at least one value (e.g. > ANY (subquery) means greater than the minimum); ALL compares with all values (e.g. > ALL (subquery) means greater than the maximum). Example: SELECT * FROM emp WHERE salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10); - returns employees earning more than everyone in department 10.",

Example: SELECT * FROM emp WHERE deptno = (SELECT deptno FROM dept WHERE location = (SELECT location FROM locations WHERE city = 'HYDERABAD')); The innermost query runs first, its result feeds the middle query, and the middle query feeds the outer query. Use cases: when the condition itself depends on another table's data. Although powerful, deeply nested subqueries can hurt readability and performance. Most modern developers prefer breaking them into multiple JOINs or using CTE (Common Table Expressions) for clarity. Best practice: avoid more than two or three levels of nesting if a cleaner alternative exists.",

ORDER BY can use expressions and aliases: SELECT ename, salary*12 AS annual FROM emp ORDER BY annual DESC; NULL values sort highest in DESC and lowest in ASC by default; use NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST (Oracle/PostgreSQL) to override. ORDER BY always runs last in query execution: FROM -> WHERE -> GROUP BY -> HAVING -> SELECT -> ORDER BY. Use ORDER BY only when needed; it adds overhead.",

    description:
      "DML (Data Manipulation Language) modifies the data inside tables. INSERT adds new rows: INSERT INTO emp(empno, ename, salary, deptno) VALUES (101, 'BSK', 50000, 10); Multi-row insert: INSERT INTO emp VALUES (102, 'RAM', 40000, 20), (103, 'RAVI', 35000, 30); Copy from another table: INSERT INTO emp_backup SELECT * FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10;. UPDATE modifies existing rows: UPDATE emp SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE deptno = 10; UPDATE with multiple columns: UPDATE emp SET salary = 60000, deptno = 20 WHERE empno = 101;. DELETE removes rows: DELETE FROM emp WHERE deptno = 30; Delete all rows: DELETE FROM emp; (slower than TRUNCATE). Always use a WHERE clause with UPDATE and DELETE; forgetting it changes/deletes every row.",

    title: "TCL - COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT - Day 34",
    description:
      "TCL (Transaction Control Language) manages transactions. A transaction is a logical unit of work - one or more SQL statements that execute as a single unit. ACID properties: Atomicity (all or nothing), Consistency (valid state to valid state), Isolation (transactions don't see each other's partial work), Durability (committed data survives crashes). COMMIT saves all changes permanently. ROLLBACK undoes all uncommitted changes since the last COMMIT. SAVEPOINT marks a point within a transaction to roll back to. Example: SAVEPOINT sp1; UPDATE emp SET salary=50000 WHERE empno=101; SAVEPOINT sp2; DELETE FROM emp WHERE deptno=30; ROLLBACK TO sp2; - this undoes the DELETE but keeps the UPDATE. Best practice: COMMIT explicitly; don't rely on auto-commit in production.",

    description:
      "DCL (Data Control Language) handles user permissions and access control. GRANT gives privileges to users: GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON emp TO user_bsk; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database.* TO 'admin'@'localhost'; GRANT SELECT ON emp TO PUBLIC; - give to everyone. REVOKE removes privileges: REVOKE INSERT ON emp FROM user_bsk; REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON emp FROM user_bsk;. Common privileges: SELECT (read), INSERT (add), UPDATE (modify), DELETE (remove), REFERENCES (create FK), ALTER (change structure), INDEX (create indexes), ALL PRIVILEGES (everything). Roles group multiple privileges: CREATE ROLE developer; GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON emp TO developer; GRANT developer TO user_bsk;. Always follow the principle of least privilege - give users only the permissions they need, nothing more.",
