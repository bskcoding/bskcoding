    title: "Microservices Introduction - Monolithic vs Microservices",
    description:
      "A microservice is a small, independent service that does ONE thing well and communicates with other services over a network. MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE puts the entire application in a single codebase and deployable unit. PROS: easy to develop initially, simple debugging. CONS: hard to maintain, scale, and deploy as codebase grows; one bug can crash the entire system; technology lock-in; cannot scale individual features. MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE splits the application into many small services, each owning its own data. PROS: independent deployment, technology freedom, fault isolation, horizontal scaling per service, small focused teams. CONS: distributed system complexity, data consistency challenges. When to use: large teams, complex domains, independent deployment needed. When NOT to use: small teams, simple CRUD apps. Spring Boot makes microservices easy with starter dependencies.",

    title: "Eureka Server - Service Discovery & Registration",
    description:
      "In microservices, services come and go. Service Discovery solves this: services REGISTER themselves with a central registry on startup and DISCOVER other services by querying it. EUREKA SERVER (Netflix OSS, integrated into Spring Cloud) is the most popular discovery server. EUREKA SERVER: standalone Spring Boot app with @EnableEurekaServer. It maintains a registry of all service instances. EUREKA CLIENT: every microservice registers and sends heartbeats every 30 seconds. If 3 heartbeats are missed, the instance is removed. SETUP: 1) Eureka Server project with spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server. 2) @EnableEurekaServer. 3) Configure register-with-eureka=false and fetch-registry=false. 4) Each microservice adds eureka client dependency and configures defaultZone. Now services find each other by NAME instead of URL.",

    title: "API Gateway 2025 Updates - Latest Features & Changes",
    description:
      "Spring Cloud Gateway is the official API Gateway for Spring Boot microservices, replacing Zuul. An API Gateway is a SINGLE ENTRY POINT for all client requests - clients call the gateway which routes to the appropriate service. BENEFITS: single entry point simplifies clients; centralized cross-cutting concerns (auth, rate limiting, logging); protocol translation; aggregation. KEY CONCEPTS: ROUTE - basic unit with ID, destination URI, predicates, filters. PREDICATE - condition to match. FILTER - modifies requests/responses. 2025 UPDATES: improved WebFlux performance, new OAuth2/JWT filters, simplified Java DSL, enhanced Micrometer observability. Compared to Zuul (synchronous, blocking), Spring Cloud Gateway is built on WebFlux (reactive, non-blocking) for much better throughput.",

    title: "Dynamic API Gateway - Routing, Load Balancing & Filters",
    description:
      "A DYNAMIC API Gateway can update routes at runtime without restart. STATIC config in application.yml requires redeployment. DYNAMIC routing: 1) Service-Discovery based - spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled=true auto-routes by service name from Eureka. 2) Database-driven - load routes from DB, refresh via /actuator/gateway/refresh. 3) Config Server based - routes in Spring Cloud Config, refresh via Bus. KEY FILTERS: StripPrefixGatewayFilterFactory removes path prefixes. RewritePathGatewayFilterFactory rewrites paths. AddRequestHeader adds headers. CircuitBreaker integrates with Resilience4J. RateLimiter throttles per user. CUSTOM FILTERS implement GlobalFilter or GatewayFilter. The gateway is the PERFECT place for cross-cutting concerns: authentication, rate limiting, request logging, CORS handling.",

    title: "Feign Client - Declarative REST Client",
    description:
      "OpenFeign is a declarative REST client - you write an INTERFACE and Spring creates the implementation. No more RestTemplate boilerplate! Setup: add spring-cloud-starter-openfeign, add @EnableFeignClients. Define an interface: @FeignClient(name=\"EMPLOYEE-SERVICE\") public interface EmployeeClient { @GetMapping(\"/api/employees/{id}\") Employee getEmployee(@PathVariable Long id); }. The name='EMPLOYEE-SERVICE' tells Feign to look up the URL from Eureka. Inject and use: @Autowired private EmployeeClient employeeClient; Employee emp = employeeClient.getEmployee(1L); BENEFITS: less code, built-in load balancing via @LoadBalanced, integration with Eureka, easy to test with @MockBean, fallback methods with Resilience4J. Feign is the MOST POPULAR way to do inter-service communication.",

    title: "RestTemplate - REST Client for Inter-Service Communication",
    description:
      "RestTemplate is Spring's classic synchronous HTTP client (predates WebClient). Setup: create a @Bean RestTemplate marked with @LoadBalanced so it resolves service names from Eureka: @Bean @LoadBalanced public RestTemplate restTemplate() { return new RestTemplate(); }. Usage: restTemplate.getForObject(\"http://EMPLOYEE-SERVICE/api/employees/\" + id, Employee.class); Note: use the SERVICE NAME (uppercase) not the URL - @LoadBalanced resolves it. Common methods: getForObject(url, Class) - GET and convert response to object. postForObject(url, body, Class) - POST with body. exchange(url, HttpMethod, HttpEntity, Class) - full control. delete(url) - DELETE. put(url, body) - PUT. RestTemplate is BLOCKING - each call waits for the response. For high-throughput microservices, prefer WebClient (reactive, non-blocking). However, RestTemplate is still widely used because it's simpler and easier to debug. Common errors: BeanNotOfRequiredTypeException if you forget @LoadBalanced; UnknownHostException if service name cannot be resolved; HttpClientErrorException for 4xx errors.",

    title: "WebClient - Reactive REST Client",
    description:
      "WebClient is Spring's modern, NON-BLOCKING, REACTIVE HTTP client (introduced in Spring 5). It's the recommended replacement for RestTemplate. Setup: add spring-webflux dependency (transitively from spring-cloud-starter-gateway or directly). Create a @Bean WebClient.Builder with @LoadBalanced: @Bean @LoadBalanced public WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder() { return WebClient.builder(); }. Usage: inject WebClient.Builder, build with service name: WebClient webClient = webClientBuilder.baseUrl(\"http://EMPLOYEE-SERVICE\").build(); Mono<Employee> employeeMono = webClient.get().uri(\"/api/employees/{id}\", id).retrieve().bodyToMono(Employee.class); Employee employee = employeeMono.block(); // or subscribe for async. KEY METHODS: .get(), .post(), .put(), .delete() - HTTP methods. .uri(path, params) - URL with path variables. .retrieve() - execute and get response spec. .bodyToMono(Class) - convert to Mono (0 or 1 result). .bodyToFlux(Class) - convert to Flux (0 to N results). WebClient handles backpressure, async composition, and is much more efficient under load. Use it for new microservices.",

    title: "Feign Client with Lists - REST Calls to Collections",
    description:
      "Day 7: extending Feign to call endpoints that return LISTS of objects and aggregate data from multiple microservices. Real microservices rarely work in isolation - a 'Order Service' may need data from Employee Service, Product Service, and Customer Service. Example: build an OrderResponse that combines employee + products: @FeignClient(name=\"EMPLOYEE-SERVICE\") interface EmployeeClient { @GetMapping(\"/api/employees\") List<Employee> getAllEmployees(); } @FeignClient(name=\"PRODUCT-SERVICE\") interface ProductClient { @GetMapping(\"/api/products\") List<Product> getAllProducts(); }. In the OrderService, inject both clients and aggregate: List<Employee> employees = employeeClient.getAllEmployees(); List<Product> products = productClient.getAllProducts(); return new OrderResponse(employees, products);. ERROR HANDLING with Feign: configure ErrorDecoder to convert HTTP errors to custom exceptions. Use @ExceptionHandler in @ControllerAdvice for global handling. For lists with pagination, use Spring Data's Page<T> return type - Feign handles it transparently. This pattern of aggregating data from multiple services is common in microservices - it's the foundation of API composition.",

    title: "RestTemplate & WebClient with Lists - Aggregating Data",
    description:
      "Day 8: same data aggregation pattern but using RestTemplate and WebClient instead of Feign. RestTemplate approach: List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(restTemplate.getForObject(\"http://EMPLOYEE-SERVICE/api/employees\", Employee[].class));. Note: RestTemplate returns arrays - we wrap in Arrays.asList. WebClient reactive approach: Flux<Employee> employeesFlux = webClient.get().uri(\"http://EMPLOYEE-SERVICE/api/employees\").retrieve().bodyToFlux(Employee.class); List<Employee> employees = employeesFlux.collectList().block(); // blocks for sync. For non-blocking aggregation: Mono<Employee[]> employeesMono = webClient.get()....bodyToMono(Employee[].class); combine multiple calls using Mono.zip: Mono.zip(employeesMono, productsMono).map(tuple -> new AggregatedResponse(tuple.getT1(), tuple.getT2())).subscribe(...); This composes async calls efficiently. PARALLEL CALLS: WebClient automatically uses connection pool for parallel requests. For RestTemplate, you'd need to use CompletableFuture + AsyncRestTemplate (deprecated). PRACTICAL: when aggregating from 3+ services, WebClient with Mono.zip is much faster than sequential RestTemplate calls. Choose based on your use case - simple sync: RestTemplate; reactive/parallel: WebClient; declarative: Feign.",

    title: "Circuit Breaker Pattern with Resilience4J",
    description:
      "In microservices, ONE slow or down service can cascade-fail the entire system. The CIRCUIT BREAKER pattern prevents this. Concept (borrowed from electrical engineering): a breaker monitors calls to a remote service. STATES: CLOSED - normal, calls pass through, monitor failure rate. OPEN - service is failing, calls FAIL FAST without hitting the remote (saves resources, gives service time to recover). HALF_OPEN - after timeout, try ONE call; if succeeds -> CLOSED, if fails -> OPEN again. Resilience4J is the modern replacement for Hystrix (Netflix, deprecated). Add spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-resilience4j. Annotate method: @CircuitBreaker(name=\"employeeService\", fallbackMethod=\"getEmployeeFallback\") public Employee getEmployee(Long id) { return employeeClient.getEmployee(id); }. When circuit is open, fallbackMethod is called: public Employee getEmployeeFallback(Long id, Throwable t) { return new Employee(id, \"Default\", \"Unknown\", 0); }. CONFIGURATION in application.yml: resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.employeeService.sliding-window-size=10, failure-rate-threshold=50, wait-duration-in-open-state=10s. Resilience4J also offers RateLimiter, Retry, Bulkhead, TimeLimiter - all essential microservices patterns.",

    title: "Circuit Breaker - Multi-Service Resilience",
    description:
      "Day 10: extending Circuit Breaker across MULTIPLE microservices with shared configuration. PATTERN: each downstream service has its own circuit breaker instance, but they share global defaults. In application.yml: resilience4j.circuitbreaker.configs.default.sliding-window-type=COUNT_BASED, sliding-window-size=100, minimum-number-of-calls=20, failure-rate-threshold=50, wait-duration-in-open-state=30s, permitted-number-of-calls-in-half-open-state=5. resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.employeeService.base-config=default. Now all circuit breakers inherit defaults but can override. OBSERVABILITY: add spring-boot-starter-actuator and micrometer-registry-prometheus to expose circuit breaker metrics: /actuator/health shows circuit breaker states. /actuator/metrics/resilience4j.circuitbreaker.calls shows call counts. Grafana dashboards visualize circuit states. ADVANCED: @Retry annotation retries failed calls before opening circuit. @Bulkhead limits concurrent calls (thread pool isolation). @TimeLimiter sets max wait time. Combine all four for robust resilience: @CircuitBreaker @Retry @Bulkhead @TimeLimiter. TESTING: use Resilience4J's CircuitBreakerRegistry in tests to programmatically force OPEN state and verify fallback. In production, integrate circuit breaker events with your alerting system.",

    title: "Load Balancing - Client-Side with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer",
    description:
      "Load Balancing distributes requests across multiple instances of a service. SERVER-SIDE load balancing: a hardware LB (F5) or software (Nginx, HAProxy) sits in front of services. CLIENT-SIDE load balancing: the client itself picks an instance from the registry. Spring Cloud LoadBalancer (SCL) is the modern replacement for Netflix Ribbon. Setup: spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer dependency (auto-included with Eureka). When you use @LoadBalanced on RestTemplate or WebClient.Builder, SCL intercepts the call, queries Eureka for all instances of 'EMPLOYEE-SERVICE', and picks one based on the load balancing RULE. Built-in rules: RoundRobinLoadBalancer (default) - rotates through instances. RandomLoadBalancer - picks randomly. WeightedResponseTimeLoadBalancer - prefers faster instances. CUSTOM RULE: implement ReactorLoadBalancer<ServiceInstance> and configure via @Bean. EX: public class CustomRule implements ReactorLoadBalancer<ServiceInstance> { public Mono<Response<ServiceInstance>> choose(...) {...} }. Use with @LoadBalancerClient(name=\"employee-service\", configuration=CustomRule.class). In Kubernetes, services do load balancing at the network level - SCL is more for non-K8s deployments.",

    description:
      "Apache Kafka is a DISTRIBUTED EVENT STREAMING platform used by Netflix, Uber, LinkedIn, Amazon for handling trillions of events per day. WHY KAFKA? Many scenarios need ASYNCHRONOUS event-driven communication: when a user places an order, you need to send email, update inventory, charge payment, notify analytics - all without blocking the user. Multiple services need to react to the same event. Handle MILLIONS of events per second without losing data. KEY PROPERTIES: high throughput (millions/sec), durable (persisted, replicated), scalable (add brokers), fault-tolerant (replication), replayable (re-read old messages), distributed. USE CASES: messaging, website activity tracking, metrics/log aggregation, stream processing, event sourcing, change data capture, IoT telemetry. This is the FOUNDATION of modern event-driven microservices.",

    description:
      "Day 13: real-time examples to build intuition for Kafka. EXAMPLE 1 - E-COMMERCE: customer places order on Amazon. Without Kafka, the Order Service synchronously calls Email, Inventory, Payment, Analytics services. With Kafka: Order Service just publishes 'OrderPlaced' event to topic and returns immediately. Other services CONSUME independently. EXAMPLE 2 - RIDE SHARING: Driver Service publishes 'LocationUpdated' events. Rider, ETA, Analytics services all consume the same stream. EXAMPLE 3 - IOT TELEMETRY: 10,000 sensors sending data every second. Kafka buffers, persists, distributes. TRADITIONAL MESSAGE QUEUE vs KAFKA: queues DELETE messages after consumption; Kafka RETAINS messages for a configured period (default 7 days). This replay-ability is the key difference - enables new consumers without re-publishing.",

    description:
      "Day 14: deep dive into Kafka's architecture. BROKER: a Kafka server that stores messages and serves clients. A Kafka CLUSTER is multiple brokers working together. TOPIC: a category/feed name for messages (like a table). Example: 'orders', 'user-events'. PARTITION: a topic is split into partitions for parallelism. Each partition is an ordered, append-only log. Each message has an OFFSET (sequential number) within its partition. PARTITION KEY: determines which partition a message goes to. Same key -> same partition -> ordering guaranteed. PRODUCER: client that publishes messages to a topic. CONSUMER: client that reads messages from a topic. A consumer belongs to a CONSUMER GROUP - multiple consumers in a group share work. Different groups all get all messages (pub-sub). ZOOKEEPER (or KRaft in new versions): coordinates brokers. REPLICATION FACTOR: each partition has copies on multiple brokers for fault tolerance (usually 3).",

STEP 4: Start Kafka: bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/kraft/server.properties. On Windows use bin\\windows\\kafka-server-start.bat. KEY FILES: server.properties - broker config (port, log retention, replication). producer.properties - default producer settings. consumer.properties - default consumer settings.
