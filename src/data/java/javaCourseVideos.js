    title: "MAANG Prep: Core Java (Programming & OOPs) - Course Overview",
    description:
      "Welcome to the MAANG Core Java Preparation course! This video introduces the full roadmap for the next 102 days. You will start from absolute zero - what Java is, how to install tools, write your first program - and progress through operators, conditionals, loops, pattern programs, math projects and finally Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) pillars: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction. The course is designed for Telugu-speaking students targeting product-based companies like MAANG (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and other top product MNCs. By the end, you will be confident writing Java code, explaining OOPs concepts, and solving beginner-to-interview level programming problems. Each day builds on the previous one, so consistency matters more than speed.",

    title: "Java Introduction - What is Java & Why Learn Java",
    description:
      "Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995 (now owned by Oracle). Java programs are platform-independent because code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This is famously summarized as 'Write Once, Run Anywhere' (WORA). Key features of Java: 1) Simple - syntax is clean and based on C++; 2) Object-Oriented - everything revolves around classes and objects; 3) Platform Independent - bytecode runs on any OS; 4) Secure - bytecode verifier, security manager, no explicit pointers; 5) Robust - strong memory management, exception handling; 6) Multithreaded - built-in support for concurrent execution; 7) High Performance - JIT compiler optimizes bytecode at runtime; 8) Distributed - supports RMI and networking. Java is widely used in enterprise backend (Spring Boot), Android apps, big data (Hadoop), and financial systems.",

    title: "Installation & Setup - JDK 21 and IntelliJ IDEA",
    description:
      "Before writing Java code, you need two things: a JDK (Java Development Kit) and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The JDK includes the compiler (javac), the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), documentation tools, and the JVM itself. For modern Java, install JDK 21 (LTS - Long Term Support). On Windows: download the .msi installer from oracle.com, run it, and the JDK will be installed in C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-21. After installation, set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to that path and add %JAVA_HOME%\\bin to your PATH so you can run java and javac from any terminal. Then install IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition is free) from jetbrains.com. During IntelliJ setup, it auto-detects the JDK. Create a new project, choose Java, pick the JDK 21, and you are ready to write your first line of Java code. Always restart your terminal after setting JAVA_HOME so the new PATH takes effect.",

    title: "First Java Program - Hello World in IntelliJ",
    description:
      "Your first Java program is traditionally called HelloWorld. Inside IntelliJ, create a new Java class called HelloWorld. Every Java program needs a main method, which is the entry point of the application. The signature is public static void main(String[] args). Here, public means accessible from anywhere, static means it can run without creating an object, void means it returns nothing, and String[] args accepts command-line arguments. To print output, use System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\"); The semicolon ; terminates every statement. After saving, click the green Run arrow (or right-click and choose Run). IntelliJ compiles Main.java into Main.class (bytecode) and the JVM executes it. Understanding this flow - source code -> compiler -> bytecode -> JVM -> output - is the foundation of all Java development.",

    title: "Java Internal Working - JDK, JRE, JVM, JIT, Bytecode",
    description:
      "Understanding how Java works under the hood separates beginners from professionals. JDK (Java Development Kit) is the full kit developers use - it contains javac (compiler), debugger, JRE, and documentation tools. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) provides the libraries and JVM needed to RUN Java programs but not to compile them. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the actual engine that executes bytecode - it is platform-specific, which is why Java itself can be platform-independent. The compilation-execution flow: 1) Write Main.java source code. 2) javac compiles it to Main.class containing bytecode (intermediate, platform-neutral instructions). 3) Class Loader loads the .class file into memory. 4) Bytecode Verifier checks it for security. 5) Interpreter reads bytecode line by line. 6) JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler kicks in for hot methods - it compiles bytecode into native machine code on the fly for huge performance gains. This is why Java is both portable AND fast.",

    title: "Java Variables - Local, Instance, Static",
    description:
      "A variable is a named container that holds a value the program can use. Syntax: type variableName = value; Example: int age = 25; Java has three main types of variables based on where they are declared. 1) Local Variable - declared inside a method, constructor, or block. It only exists while that method is executing and must be initialized before use. 2) Instance Variable (also called field) - declared inside a class but outside any method. Each object of the class has its own copy. Default values are assigned (0, null, false) automatically. 3) Static Variable - declared with the static keyword inside a class but outside methods. There is only ONE copy shared across ALL objects of the class. It belongs to the class, not any object. Use it for constants or counters, e.g. static int count = 0;. Best practice: declare variables close to where they are used, give them meaningful names, and follow camelCase naming.",

    title: "Java Data Types - Primitive and Non-Primitive",
    description:
      "Every variable in Java must have a data type that tells the compiler what kind of value it holds. Java is strongly typed, which catches many bugs at compile time. PRIMITIVE types (8 total, lowercase) hold simple values directly in memory: byte (1 byte, -128 to 127), short (2 bytes, -32768 to 32767), int (4 bytes, default integer type, ~±2 billion), long (8 bytes, for big numbers, suffix L), float (4 bytes, decimal, suffix f), double (8 bytes, default decimal type, more precision), char (2 bytes, single character in single quotes like 'A' or Unicode), boolean (1 bit, true or false). NON-PRIMITIVE (reference) types store the address of an object: String (sequence of chars), Arrays, Classes, Interfaces, Enums. They start with uppercase by convention. Default size of int is 32 bits which makes it fast on modern CPUs - this is why Java chose int as the default integer type instead of short.",

    title: "Java Literals - int, float, double, char, String, boolean",
    description:
      "A literal is the actual fixed value you assign to a variable. The compiler picks the literal type from its syntax. Integer literals: decimal (123), octal (leading 0, e.g. 0123), hexadecimal (leading 0x, e.g. 0xFF), binary (leading 0b, e.g. 0b1010), and you can use underscore _ for readability (1_000_000 means one million). Floating-point literals default to double; append f for float: 3.14f. Scientific notation: 1.5e3 means 1500.0. Character literals use single quotes: 'A', '7', '\\n' (newline escape). String literals use double quotes: \"Hello BSK\". Common escape sequences: \\n newline, \\t tab, \\' single quote, \\\" double quote, \\\\ backslash. Boolean literals are only true and false (lowercase, no quotes). Knowing these distinctions prevents subtle bugs - e.g. writing float x = 3.14; fails because 3.14 is double by default.",

    title: "Type Casting - Widening and Narrowing in Java",
    description:
      "Type casting converts a value from one data type to another. Two kinds exist. 1) Widening (Implicit / Automatic) - converting a smaller type to a larger one. Goes byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double. Safe, no data loss, the compiler does it automatically. Example: int x = 10; double y = x; // y is 10.0. 2) Narrowing (Explicit / Manual) - converting a larger type to a smaller one. Requires a cast operator because data loss can occur. Example: double y = 9.78; int x = (int) y; // x becomes 9 (decimal part dropped, NOT rounded). When narrowing beyond the range, you get unexpected values due to overflow. For objects, casting between related types (like Integer to Number) works only along the inheritance chain. Always prefer widening when possible; narrow only when you really need to.",

    title: "Arithmetic Operators in Java",
    description:
      "Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations on numeric operands. + addition, - subtraction, * multiplication, / division, % modulus (remainder after division). All work on int, long, float, double. Examples: int a = 10, b = 3; a + b = 13; a - b = 7; a * b = 30; a / b = 3 (integer division drops the decimal because both are int!); a % b = 1. To get decimal result, cast one operand first: (double)a / b gives 3.3333.... Modulus is extremely useful for: checking even/odd (n % 2 == 0), extracting digits (n % 10 gives the last digit), wrapping around (i % array.length), and FizzBuzz-style problems. Operator precedence follows standard math: * / % before + -. Use parentheses to be explicit and avoid bugs.",

    title: "Unary Operators in Java",
    description:
      "Unary operators work on a SINGLE operand. The most common are: Unary plus (+) - indicates a positive value, rarely used because numbers default to positive. Unary minus (-) - negates a value: int x = 5; int y = -x; // y = -5. Increment (++) - increases a value by 1. Two forms: pre-increment ++x (value is incremented FIRST, then used) and post-increment x++ (current value used FIRST, then incremented). Example: int a = 5; int b = ++a; // a=6, b=6. int c = 5; int d = c++; // c=6, d=5. Decrement (--) - decreases by 1, same pre/post rules apply. Logical NOT (!) - flips a boolean: !true = false; !false = true; !(x > 5) means 'x is not greater than 5'. Bitwise NOT (~) - flips every bit of an integer. Common interview trap: print i++ vs ++i in loops. Always remember: pre = change then use, post = use then change.",

    title: "Relational Operators in Java",
    description:
      "Relational operators compare two values and return a boolean (true or false). They are the foundation of decision-making. == equal to, != not equal to, > greater than, >= greater than or equal to, < less than, <= less than or equal to. Example: int age = 18; boolean canVote = age >= 18; // true. WARNING: For primitives == compares actual values. For objects (like Strings), == compares memory addresses (references) - to compare contents use .equals() instead. Common pattern: if (marks >= 50) result = \"Pass\"; else result = \"Fail\";. They are mostly used inside if, while, for conditions. Precedence is lower than arithmetic, so 5 + 3 > 7 evaluates as (5+3) > 7. You can chain them in some languages but Java does not allow chained relational operators like Python does (a < b < c is invalid).",

    title: "Logical Operators in Java",

      "Logical operators combine multiple boolean expressions. Logical AND (&&) - returns true only if BOTH operands are true. Short-circuit: if the left side is false, the right side is not evaluated. Example: if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) canDrive = true;. Logical OR (||) - returns true if AT LEAST ONE operand is true. Short-circuit: if left is true, right is not evaluated. Example: if (day == 6 || day == 7) isWeekend = true;. Logical NOT (!) - inverts a boolean. Example: if (!isRaining) goOutside = true;. Common use cases: input validation (username != null && username.length() > 0), complex eligibility (salary > 50000 && experience > 3), range checks (score >= 0 && score <= 100). Use parentheses to avoid confusion when mixing && and || (&& binds tighter than ||).",

    title: "Bitwise Operators in Java",
    description:
      "Bitwise operators work directly on the binary (bit) representation of integers. Bitwise AND (&) - each bit is 1 only if both bits are 1. Useful for masking: (n & 1) tells if a number is odd. Bitwise OR (|) - each bit is 1 if at least one bit is 1. Bitwise XOR (^) - each bit is 1 only if bits differ. Clever trick: a ^ a = 0 and a ^ 0 = a (great for finding unique numbers). Bitwise Complement (~) - flips every bit: ~n = -(n+1). Left Shift (<<) - shifts bits left, fills with zeros. n << k is equivalent to n * 2^k. Right Shift (>>) - shifts bits right preserving sign bit. n >> k is n / 2^k. Unsigned Right Shift (>>>) - shifts right but fills with zeros regardless of sign. Useful in low-level code, performance optimization, image processing, and competitive programming.",

    title: "Assignment Operators in Java",
    description:
      "Assignment operators assign a value to a variable. Simple assignment (=) - x = 5. Compound assignment operators combine an arithmetic or bitwise operation with assignment. They make code shorter and are equivalent to x = x op value. Forms: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=, >>>=. Example: int balance = 1000; balance += 500; // balance is 1500. Compound assignment does an implicit cast: byte b = 10; b = b + 5; // compile error! b += 5; // works because it's b = (byte)(b+5). Use compound operators for readability and slightly better performance. In interviews, knowing the implicit cast rule can save you from confusing compile errors.",

    title: "Ternary Operator in Java",

      "The ternary operator is the only operator that takes THREE operands. It is a compact one-line if-else. Syntax: condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse. Example: int a = 10, b = 20; int max = (a > b) ? a : b; // max = 20. Equivalent to: int max; if (a > b) max = a; else max = b;. It returns a value, so it must be used in an expression context. Nested ternaries are allowed but hurt readability quickly. Best practice: use ternary only for SHORT, SIMPLE conditions. If the logic is more than one line of thought, switch to if-else. It is interview-friendly because it shows you can write concise code without sacrificing clarity.",

Java enforces strict rules on what makes a valid identifier: 1) Can contain letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), underscore (_), and dollar sign ($). 2) Must NOT start with a digit (3sum is invalid, sum3 is fine). 3) Cannot be a Java keyword (class, int, while, etc. are reserved). 4) Case-sensitive: Age and age are different identifiers. 5) No limit on length. 6) No spaces or special characters like @, #, %. Naming CONVENTIONS (not enforced but expected): Classes & Interfaces - PascalCase like StudentDetails, ArrayList. Variables & Methods - camelCase like employeeName, calculateSalary(). Constants - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE like MAX_VALUE, PI. Packages - all lowercase like com.bskcoding.project. Following conventions makes your code instantly readable to other Java developers and helps during code reviews and interviews.",

Read temperature in Fahrenheit from user using Scanner, apply formula, print Celsius. Be careful with integer division - cast one operand to double to get accurate results. 2) Swap two numbers using a third variable: Store the first value in a temp variable, assign second to first, then temp to second. 3) Add four numbers: Use Scanner.nextInt() four times, sum them, print the total. 4) Swap two numbers WITHOUT using a third variable: Use arithmetic (a = a + b; b = a - b; a = a - b;) OR use multiplication/division.

Fahrenheit to Celsius: Read input with Scanner.nextDouble(), apply formula (F - 32) * 5.0/9.0 (note the .0 forces double division), print result with two decimals using printf(\"%.2f\", c). Swap with third variable: int a, b, temp; temp = a; a = b; b = temp; - clean and universally readable. Add four numbers: int sum = 0; sum += sc.nextInt(); // repeat four times. The compound += keeps code short. Swap without third variable: Method 1 (arithmetic) a = a + b; b = a - b; a = a - b; Method 2 (multiplication) a = a * b; b = a / b; a = a / b; - but multiplication swap fails if a or b is 0, so the addition method is preferred.

    title: "Java if Statement - Conditional Execution",
    description:
      "The if statement lets your program make decisions and execute code conditionally. Syntax: if (condition) { // code block runs only if condition is true }. The condition must be a boolean expression. Example: if (raining) { takeUmbrella(); }. If you omit the braces when the body is one line, only the next line is conditional - which is risky and considered bad practice. Always use braces {}. The if condition can use any relational or logical operator: if (age > 18 && hasVoterId). A common beginner pattern: int n = 7; if (n % 2 == 0) System.out.println(\"Even\");. The if statement alone executes a block only when true - it does nothing when false. Use it when you need a 'do something only if X' check without an alternative path.",

Syntax: if (condition) { // true branch } else { // false branch }. Example: if (raining) { takeUmbrella(); } else { goOutside(); }. Common uses: even/odd check (if n%2==0 print Even else Odd), pass/fail (if marks>=50 print Pass else Fail), max of two (if a>b max=a else max=b). Without else, when condition is false nothing happens - which is sometimes desired but usually you want a fallback. Real-world pattern: if (loggedIn) showDashboard(); else showLogin();. Always end with else when there is a default action - it makes the logic complete and prevents unhandled cases.",

Conditions are evaluated top-down; the FIRST true condition wins and its block runs - all remaining else-ifs are skipped. Example: if (marks >= 90) grade = 'A'; else if (marks >= 75) grade = 'B'; else if (marks >= 50) grade = 'C'; else grade = 'F';. The final else is optional but recommended as a catch-all default. Ladder rules: 1) Order conditions from most specific to most general. 2) Use range checks carefully. 3) Avoid overlapping ranges. 4) Maximum recommended depth: 3-4 levels.

Syntax: switch (expression) { case value1: // code; break; case value2: // code; break; default: // code; }. The expression must be byte, short, char, int, String (Java 7+), or enum. Critical: each case usually ends with break - omitting it causes FALL-THROUGH. Default runs when no case matches. Example: switch (day) { case 1: print \"Mon\"; break; case 2: print \"Tue\"; break; default: print \"Other\"; }. Switch is faster than long ladders because the compiler may optimize it to a jump table.",

    title: "Java while Loop - Condition-Based Iteration",
    description:
      "The while loop is used when you DON'T know in advance how many iterations are needed. Syntax: while (condition) { // body } The condition is checked BEFORE each iteration. If false initially, the body never runs (zero iterations). Example: int i = 1; while (i <= 5) { System.out.println(i); i++; }. Common pitfalls: 1) Forgetting to update the loop variable - causes INFINITE LOOP. 2) Wrong condition direction. Use while when: waiting for valid user input (while (!correctPassword), reading until end-of-file, indefinite polling. Use for when iteration count is known. The while loop is also great for menu-driven programs: while (!exit) { showMenu(); readChoice(); process(); }.",

Perfect for: 1) Menu-driven programs that should display at least once. 2) Validating input that must be attempted at least once. 3) Game loops that should run one round before checking exit.

      "Day 51 combines several pattern styles in one video. Example output patterns: 11111 / 12345 / 12111 / 22111 / 12345 / 12311 / 33311 / 12345 / 12341 / 44441 / 12345 / 12345 / 55555 / 12345. Each row has different logic - some rows are constant (11111), some are sequential (12345), some are repeats. The trick is to identify each row's rule separately. Approach: write code for one row at a time, run, verify, then move to the next. Use if-else inside the outer loop or separate print statements for each row. This trains you to translate mental patterns into nested loops systematically.",

Variations: 1) Print X pattern (only when i==j or i+j==n+1). 2) Print plus sign (only when i==mid or j==mid). 3) Print diagonal. These patterns train conditional logic inside nested loops.",

    description:
      "OOPs is a programming paradigm built around OBJECTS that bundle data (fields) and behavior (methods). Java is fundamentally an OOPs language - almost everything is inside a class. Why OOPs? 1) Models real-world entities (Student, Car, Order). 2) Promotes code reuse via inheritance. 3) Encapsulation hides complexity and protects data. 4) Easier maintenance. 5) Polymorphism lets the same interface handle different types. The four pillars of OOPs: 1) ENCAPSULATION - bundling data + methods, hiding internals via private fields and public getters/setters. 2) INHERITANCE - child class inherits properties from parent (extends keyword). 3) POLYMORPHISM - same name, different behavior (overloading, overriding). 4) ABSTRACTION - hiding complex implementation behind a simple interface.",

An object is an INSTANCE of a class - a specific realization with actual values. Example: class Car { String color; int speed; void drive() { System.out.println(\"Driving at \" + speed); } }. To create an object: Car myCar = new Car(); myCar.color = \"Red\"; myCar.speed = 100; myCar.drive();. Each object has its OWN copy of instance variables. The 'new' keyword allocates memory and calls the constructor.",

      "A constructor is a special method that runs when an object is created (via 'new'). It initializes the object's fields. Rules: 1) Constructor name = class name. 2) No return type (not even void). 3) Called automatically with 'new'. Types: 1) Default (no-arg) constructor. 2) Parameterized constructor - Student(String name, int rollNo) { this.name = name; this.rollNo = rollNo; }. 3) Copy constructor. The 'this' keyword refers to the CURRENT object - this.name disambiguates between the field and the parameter with the same name. Constructor overloading lets you create objects in multiple ways.",

Method signatures: can have parameters (or none), return a value (or void), be static (class-level) or instance (object-level). Method Overloading - same method name with DIFFERENT parameter lists (different number, types, or order). Example: int add(int a, int b) and double add(double a, double b). The compiler picks the right one based on the call (compile-time polymorphism). Methods break programs into small, manageable pieces.",
