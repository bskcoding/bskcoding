    description:
      "Data Structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are classified into two main categories: Linear Data Structures (where elements are arranged in a sequential fashion and each element is connected to only one other element) - including Arrays, Stack, Queue, and Linked List; and Non-Linear Data Structures (where elements are arranged in a hierarchical manner and each element can be connected to N other elements) - including Trees and Graphs. Data Structures are also classified as Static (fixed size determined at compile time, like Arrays) and Dynamic (size can change at runtime based on requirements, like Stack, Queue, and Linked List).",

    title: "DSA Recursion Programs [ Day-2 ]",
    description:
      "Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself continuously to solve a problem. A method that calls itself is called a recursive method. Every recursive method must have: 1) A base case that stops the recursion, and 2) A recursive call that reduces the problem to a smaller subproblem. Recursion follows the concept of solving a larger problem by breaking it down into smaller, identical problems. Problems covered: Question 1 - Print numbers from N to 1 using recursion; Question 2 - Print numbers from 1 to N using recursion; Question 3 - Calculate factorial of N using recursion; Question 4 - Calculate sum of N natural numbers using recursion.",

      "Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements 'bubble' to the top (beginning) or larger elements 'bubble' to the bottom (end) of the list. Each pass through the array places the next largest element in its correct position. The time complexity is O(n²) in the worst case, making it inefficient for large datasets. It is a stable sort and requires O(1) additional space.",

    title: "DSA Bubble Sort Algorithm Programs [ Day-8 ]",
    description:
      "Bubble Sort can be modified to sort in descending order by changing the comparison condition to swap when the adjacent element is greater than the current element (instead of smaller). An optimization technique is early termination: if no swaps occur during a pass, the array is already sorted and we can stop early. This makes Bubble Sort efficient for partially sorted arrays. The best case complexity becomes O(n) when the array is already sorted. Bubble Sort is primarily used for educational purposes due to its simplicity.",

The algorithm maintains two subarrays: one that is already sorted (at the front) and one that is unsorted (remaining elements). In each iteration, it selects the smallest element from the unsorted subarray and swaps it with the first unsorted element. Selection Sort has O(n²) time complexity in all cases (best, average, worst), making it inefficient for large datasets. It requires only O(1) extra space and is not stable.",

      "Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works similarly to how you sort playing cards in your hands: you take each element and insert it into its correct position among the already sorted elements. The algorithm starts from the second element, compares it with the previous elements, and shifts larger elements to the right to make space for the current element. Insertion Sort has O(n²) time complexity in worst case but O(n) in best case (when array is already sorted). It is stable, adaptive, and efficient for small datasets.",

      "Quick Sort is a highly efficient Divide and Conquer sorting algorithm. It selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array such that all elements smaller than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. The pivot element is then placed in its correct sorted position. The algorithm recursively sorts the subarrays on both sides of the pivot. Common pivot selection strategies include: picking the first element, picking the last element, picking a random element, or picking the median. Quick Sort has O(n log n) average-case time complexity but O(n²) worst-case (when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element). It is an in-place sort with O(log n) space complexity for the recursion stack.",

      "Merge Sort is a classic Divide and Conquer sorting algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves into a single sorted array. The merging process compares the smallest elements from each half and places the smaller one into the result array. Merge Sort guarantees O(n log n) time complexity in all cases (best, average, worst), making it consistently efficient. It requires O(n) additional space for the temporary merge array, making it not an in-place sort. Merge Sort is stable and is particularly efficient for sorting linked lists and large datasets.",

    title: "DSA Binary Search Algorithm Programs [ Day-13 ]",
    description:
      "Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The algorithm compares the target value with the middle element of the array. If they match, the search is successful. If the target is less than the middle element, the search continues on the left half; if greater, on the right half. This process repeats until the target is found or the interval becomes empty. Binary Search has O(log n) time complexity, making it significantly faster than linear search for large datasets. It can be implemented iteratively or recursively.",

The algorithm follows these steps: Step 1 - Traverse the array from the beginning; Step 2 - Match the key element with each array element; Step 3 - If the key is found, return the index position; Step 4 - If the key is not found after traversing all elements, return -1. Linear Search has O(n) time complexity, making it slower than Binary Search for sorted data. However, it works on unsorted data and is simple to implement.",

      "Interpolation Search is an improved variant of Binary Search that works efficiently on uniformly distributed sorted data. Instead of always checking the middle element, Interpolation Search calculates the probable position of the search element using the formula: pos = low + ((target - arr[low]) * (high - low) / (arr[high] - arr[low])). This probing position estimation allows the algorithm to find the element faster when the data is uniformly distributed. Interpolation Search has O(log log n) time complexity for uniformly distributed data, but degrades to O(n) in worst case. The data collection must be sorted for this algorithm to work properly.",

Arrays are Static Data Structures, meaning their size is declared and fixed at compile time and cannot be changed later. Types of arrays include: One-dimensional Array (single row of elements), Two-dimensional Array (matrix with rows and columns), and Three-dimensional Array (collection of 2D arrays).

Each node points to the next element, and the last node points to null, indicating the end of the list. Unlike arrays, linked lists are Dynamic Data Structures - their size can grow or shrink at runtime. Operations on singly linked lists include insertion (at beginning, end, or specified position), deletion (from beginning, end, or specified position), and traversal.

This bidirectional structure allows traversal in both forward and backward directions. The previous pointer of the first node points to null, and the next pointer of the last node points to null. Doubly linked lists support more efficient deletion operations (especially deletion of a given node without traversing from the start) compared to singly linked lists.

In a circular singly linked list, there is no beginning or end, and no null value is present in the next part of any node. The circular structure means the list can be traversed starting from any node and will eventually return to the starting node. This structure is useful for applications that require repeated round-robin traversal, such as CPU scheduling algorithms and multi-player game turn management.",
