    title: "Two Sum",
    description:
      "Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. Each input has exactly one solution, and the same element cannot be used twice.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use a HashMap to store each number and its index as we traverse the array. For each element nums[i], calculate the complement = target - nums[i]. If the complement already exists in the map, we found our pair and return [map[complement], i]. Otherwise, store nums[i] with its index in the map. This gives O(n) time complexity because each lookup and insertion in a hash map is O(1). The brute force approach would be O(n²) using nested loops. Space complexity is O(n) for the hash map. Key insight: instead of checking all pairs, we only need to check if the complement of each number exists in the array.",
    example:
      "Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\nOutput: [0,1]\nExplanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9",

    title: "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock",
    description:
      "You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve. If no profit can be achieved, return 0.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use a single pass with two variables. Track the minimum price seen so far (minPrice) and the maximum profit (maxProfit). For each price, update minPrice = min(minPrice, price) and calculate profit = price - minPrice, then update maxProfit = max(maxProfit, profit). The key insight is that we want to buy at the lowest price before the selling day. By tracking the minimum price as we traverse, we ensure we always consider buying at the lowest possible price before the current day. Time complexity is O(n) with a single pass, space complexity is O(1). The greedy approach works because we only need to find the maximum difference where the buy day comes before the sell day.",
    example:
      "Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: Buy on day 2 (price=1) and sell on day 5 (price=6), profit = 6-1 = 5",

    title: "Contains Duplicate",
    description:
      "Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use a HashSet to track seen elements. Iterate through the array, for each element check if it already exists in the set. If yes, return true (duplicate found). If not, add it to the set. If we complete the loop without finding duplicates, return false. Time complexity is O(n) because each set operation (add/contains) is O(1) on average. Space complexity is O(n) for the set. Alternative approaches: sort the array first (O(n log n)) and check adjacent elements, or use a brute force nested loop (O(n²)). The HashSet approach is optimal for this problem.",

    description:
      "Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]. The solution must run in O(n) time without using the division operation.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use prefix and suffix product arrays. First pass: create a prefix array where prefix[i] = product of all elements before index i. Second pass: create a suffix array where suffix[i] = product of all elements after index i. Then result[i] = prefix[i] * suffix[i]. To optimize space to O(1) (excluding output array), we can use the output array itself: first pass store prefix products in the output array, then second pass multiply by suffix products using a running variable. Time complexity is O(n) with two passes, space complexity is O(1) extra space. The key constraint is not using division, which would be the naive approach (total product / nums[i]).",
    example:
      "Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: [24,12,8,6]\nExplanation: answer[0] = 2*3*4 = 24, answer[1] = 1*3*4 = 12, etc.",

    title: "Maximum Subarray",
    description:
      "Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use Kadane's Algorithm. Maintain two variables: currentSum (sum of the current subarray) and maxSum (maximum sum found so far). Iterate through the array, for each element add it to currentSum. Update maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum). If currentSum becomes negative, reset it to 0 because starting a new subarray from the next element is always better than continuing with a negative sum. Time complexity is O(n) with a single pass, space complexity is O(1). The key insight is that a negative prefix sum never helps maximize the subarray sum, so we discard it. This is a classic example of dynamic programming where the optimal solution at each step depends only on the previous step.",
    example:
      "Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6",

    title: "Maximum Product Subarray",
    description:
      "Given an integer array nums, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: This is trickier than Maximum Subarray because negative numbers can flip the sign. We need to track both the maximum product and minimum product ending at each position. When we encounter a negative number, the maximum and minimum swap roles (multiplying a negative by the minimum gives the maximum). Maintain curMax and curMin. For each element, compute: tempMax = max(nums[i], curMax * nums[i], curMin * nums[i]) and curMin = min(nums[i], curMax * nums[i], curMin * nums[i]). Update result = max(result, curMax). Time complexity is O(n), space complexity is O(1). The key insight is that a negative number can turn a small (negative) product into a large positive product.",

    title: "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array",
    description:
      "Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array. The solution must run in O(log n) time.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use binary search. The rotated array has two sorted halves. The minimum element is the pivot point where the rotation happened. In a rotated sorted array, the minimum element is the only element that is smaller than its previous element. Use binary search: if nums[mid] > nums[right], the minimum is in the right half (because the left half is sorted and larger). Otherwise, the minimum is in the left half (including mid). Continue until left == right, which is the minimum. Time complexity is O(log n), space complexity is O(1). The key insight is that comparing nums[mid] with nums[right] tells us which half contains the rotation point.",
    example:
      "Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The original array [1,2,3,4,5] was rotated 3 times",

    title: "Search in Rotated Sorted Array",
    description:
      "There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index. Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums. The solution must run in O(log n) time.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use modified binary search. At each step, determine which half is sorted. If nums[left] <= nums[mid], the left half is sorted. Check if target is in the left half's range (nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]), if yes search left, otherwise search right. If the right half is sorted (nums[mid] <= nums[right]), check if target is in the right half's range (nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]), if yes search right, otherwise search left. Continue until found or left > right. Time complexity is O(log n), space complexity is O(1). The key insight is that in a rotated sorted array, at least one half is always sorted, and we can determine which half to search based on the target's value.",
    example:
      "Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: 0 is at index 4 in the array",

    explanation:
      "Approach: Sort the array first. Then fix one element (nums[i]) and use two pointers (left = i+1, right = n-1) to find pairs that sum to -nums[i]. For each i, if nums[i] > 0, break (since array is sorted, all remaining numbers are positive). Skip duplicate values of i. For the two-pointer part: if sum < 0, move left pointer right; if sum > 0, move right pointer left; if sum == 0, add the triplet and move both pointers while skipping duplicates. Time complexity is O(n²) because for each i we do a two-pointer scan, space complexity is O(1) excluding the output. The key insight is sorting enables the two-pointer technique and easy duplicate handling.",
    example:
      "Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]\nOutput: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]\nExplanation: These are the only triplets that sum to 0",

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use two pointers, one at the start (left) and one at the end (right). Calculate the area as (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right]). Update maxArea if current area is larger. Then move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward. Why? Because the area is limited by the shorter line. Moving the taller line inward would only decrease the width without potentially increasing the height (since the shorter line still limits it). Moving the shorter line inward might find a taller line that increases the area. Time complexity is O(n) with a single pass, space complexity is O(1). The key insight is that the optimal solution always involves moving the shorter pointer.",
    example:
      "Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]\nOutput: 49\nExplanation: Lines at index 1 and 8 form the max area = 7 * 7 = 49",

    description:
      "Given an m x n integer matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. The operation must be done in-place.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use the first row and first column as markers. First, check if the first row and first column themselves contain any zeros (store these in boolean flags). Then, iterate through the rest of the matrix. If matrix[i][j] == 0, set matrix[i][0] = 0 and matrix[0][j] = 0 as markers. After this, iterate again and for each cell, if matrix[i][0] == 0 or matrix[0][j] == 0, set matrix[i][j] = 0. Finally, handle the first row and first column based on the boolean flags. Time complexity is O(m*n), space complexity is O(1). The key insight is using the first row/column as in-place markers to avoid extra space.",
    example:
      "Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]\nOutput: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]\nExplanation: The cell (1,1) is 0, so row 1 and column 1 become 0",

    title: "Spiral Matrix",
    description:
      "Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use four boundary variables: top, bottom, left, right. Traverse in four directions: 1) Move right along the top row (from left to right), then increment top. 2) Move down along the right column (from top to bottom), then decrement right. 3) Move left along the bottom row (from right to left), then decrement bottom. 4) Move up along the left column (from bottom to top), then increment left. Repeat until top > bottom or left > right. Time complexity is O(m*n) since we visit each cell once, space complexity is O(1) excluding the output array. The key insight is carefully updating boundaries after each direction traversal.",

    description:
      "You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise). You have to rotate the image in-place.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise can be done in two steps: 1) Transpose the matrix (swap matrix[i][j] with matrix[j][i] for all i < j). 2) Reverse each row. Transpose converts rows to columns, and then reversing each row completes the 90-degree clockwise rotation. For example, [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] transposed becomes [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]], and reversing each row gives [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]. Time complexity is O(n²) since we visit each cell, space complexity is O(1) for in-place rotation. The key insight is decomposing the rotation into transpose + row reversal.",

    explanation:
      "Approach: Use DFS with backtracking. For each cell in the board, if it matches the first character of the word, start a DFS from that cell. In the DFS, check if the current character matches the word character at the current index. If we reach the end of the word, return true. Mark the current cell as visited (e.g., change it to a special character or use a visited set). Then recursively explore all four directions (up, down, left, right). After exploring, unmark the cell (backtrack) so it can be used in other paths. Time complexity is O(m*n*4^L) where L is the length of the word, space complexity is O(L) for the recursion stack.

    title: "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters",
    description:
      "Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use the sliding window technique with a HashMap. Maintain two pointers: left and right. Expand the window by moving right. For each character at right, if it's already in the map, move left to max(left, map[char] + 1) to skip past the previous occurrence. Update map[char] = right. The current window length is right - left + 1, update maxLength. Time complexity is O(n) because each character is processed at most twice (once when added, once when removed), space complexity is O(min(n, alphabet size)) for the map. The key insight is using the map to track the last occurrence of each character to efficiently shrink the window.",

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use the sliding window technique with a frequency array. Maintain left and right pointers and a count array for character frequencies. Expand the window by moving right and incrementing the frequency of the new character. Track maxFreq = the maximum frequency of any character in the current window. The window is valid if (windowLength - maxFreq) <= k, meaning we can replace the remaining characters to make them all the same. If the window becomes invalid, shrink it by moving left and decrementing frequencies. The answer is the maximum window length. Time complexity is O(n), space complexity is O(26) for the frequency array. The key insight is that the window is valid if the number of characters to replace (window length - max frequency) is at most k.",

      'Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".',
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use the sliding window technique with two frequency maps. First, build a frequency map for string t (required characters). Then use two pointers (left, right) to maintain a window in s. Expand the window by moving right, and for each character, decrement its count in the window map. Track how many required characters are satisfied (formed). When formed == t.length(), the window contains all required characters. Now try to shrink the window by moving left while the window is still valid. Track the minimum window length and its start position. Time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of s, space complexity is O(m) where m is the size of the character set.

      "Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: There are two main approaches. 1) Sorting: Sort both strings and compare them. If they are equal, they are anagrams. Time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting. 2) Frequency counting: Use a frequency array (size 26 for lowercase letters) or a HashMap. Increment counts for characters in s, decrement for characters in t. If all counts are zero at the end, they are anagrams. Time complexity is O(n), space complexity is O(1) for a fixed-size frequency array. The key insight is that anagrams have the same character frequencies, so comparing frequencies is sufficient.",

    title: "Group Anagrams",
    description:
      "Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use a HashMap where the key is a canonical representation of an anagram group. For each string, create a key by either: 1) Sorting the characters (e.g., 'eat' -> 'aet'), or 2) Creating a frequency array of 26 counts and converting it to a string key. Add the string to the list at that key. Finally, return all the lists in the map. Time complexity is O(n * k log k) for the sorting approach (where k is the max string length) or O(n * k) for the frequency approach, space complexity is O(n * k). The key insight is finding a canonical key that is the same for all anagrams.",

Second pass: traverse to the node before the target node (position length - n - 1) and update its next pointer to skip the target node. Handle the edge case where the head itself needs to be removed (n == length). Time complexity is O(n) with two passes, space complexity is O(1). Alternative single-pass approach: use two pointers with a gap of n between them. Move the fast pointer n steps ahead, then move both pointers until fast reaches the end.

    explanation:
      "Approach: Use a single-pass two-pointer technique. Create a dummy node pointing to head. Initialize slow and fast pointers both at the dummy node. Move the fast pointer n+1 steps ahead (creating a gap of n+1 between slow and fast). Then move both pointers one step at a time until fast reaches null. At this point, slow is at the node before the target node. Update slow.next = slow.next.next to remove the target. Time complexity is O(n) with a single pass, space complexity is O(1). Alternative recursive approach: recursively traverse to the end, and during backtracking, count the depth from the end. When the depth equals n, remove the current node. The recursive approach has O(n) space for the recursion stack.

      "Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST). A valid BST is defined as follows: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use range-based recursion. For each node, maintain a valid range (min, max). The root can be any value. For the left child, the valid range is (min, root.val). For the right child, the valid range is (root.val, max). If any node's value is outside its valid range, the tree is not a valid BST. Use null (or Long.MIN_VALUE/MAX_VALUE) for unbounded ranges. Time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes, space complexity is O(h) for the recursion stack.

When the count reaches k, return the current node's value. This can be done recursively (with a counter and result variable) or iteratively (using a stack). Time complexity is O(h + k) where h is the height of the tree (we need to reach the leftmost node first), space complexity is O(h) for the recursion stack or explicit stack.

If both p.val and q.val are greater than root.val, the LCA is in the right subtree, so move to root.right.

    explanation:
      "Approach: Implement a Trie using a tree of nodes. Each node has: an array (or map) of children (26 for lowercase letters) and a boolean flag indicating if the node represents the end of a word. insert(word): traverse the trie character by character, creating new nodes as needed, and mark the last node as end-of-word. search(word): traverse the trie, if any character is missing, return false; at the end, return the end-of-word flag. startsWith(prefix): traverse the trie, if any character is missing, return false; otherwise return true (no need to check end-of-word). Time complexity is O(L) for all operations where L is the length of the word/prefix, space complexity is O(n * L) where n is the number of words and L is the average word length.

For each character: if it's a regular character, follow the corresponding child. If it's a '.', try all children at that level (recursively search each child for the remaining characters). If any path leads to a valid word, return true. Time complexity is O(L) for addWord and O(26^L) in the worst case for search (when the word is all dots), space complexity is O(n * L) for the trie.

      "Approach: Combine Trie with DFS backtracking. 1) Build a Trie from all the words. 2) For each cell in the board, start a DFS. 3) In the DFS, check if the current character exists in the Trie. If not, backtrack. 4) If the current Trie node marks the end of a word, add the word to the result. 5) Mark the current cell as visited, explore all four directions, then unmark (backtrack). 6) To avoid duplicates, remove the word from the Trie once found (or use a set). Time complexity is O(m * n * 4^L) where L is the maximum word length, space complexity is O(total characters in all words) for the Trie.

    explanation:
      "Approach: Instead of checking from each cell whether water can flow to both oceans (which is expensive), work backwards from the oceans. Water flows from a cell to a neighbor if neighbor's height <= current cell's height. So, water can flow from a neighbor to a cell if cell's height >= neighbor's height. Start DFS/BFS from the Pacific ocean boundary (top row and left column) and mark all cells reachable by flowing uphill (where current height >= neighbor height). Similarly, start from the Atlantic ocean boundary (bottom row and right column). A cell can flow to both oceans if it's reachable from both the Pacific and Atlantic starting points.

      "Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use patience sorting with binary search for O(n log n) time. Maintain an array 'tails' where tails[i] is the smallest possible tail value of an increasing subsequence of length i+1. For each number in nums: use binary search to find the position in tails where this number should go (the first element >= num). If found, replace it; if not found (num is larger than all), append it. The length of tails is the answer. Time complexity is O(n log n), space complexity is O(n). Alternative DP approach: dp[i] = length of LIS ending at index i, dp[i] = 1 + max(dp[j]) for all j < i where nums[j] < nums[i], with O(n²) time. The key insight is that maintaining the smallest tail values allows binary search to find the correct position efficiently.",

    title: "Longest Common Subsequence",
    description:
      "Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0. A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use 2D dynamic programming. Create a dp table of size (m+1) x (n+1) where m and n are the lengths of the two strings. dp[i][j] represents the length of the LCS of text1[0..i-1] and text2[0..j-1]. Base case: dp[0][j] = 0 and dp[i][0] = 0 (empty string has LCS length 0). Transition: if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1], dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1. Otherwise, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]). The answer is dp[m][n]. Time complexity is O(m * n), space complexity is O(m * n) (can be optimized to O(min(m, n)) using a 1D array). The key insight is that when characters match, we extend the LCS of the prefixes; when they don't, we take the best of skipping one character from either string.",

      "Approach: Use dynamic programming. Create a boolean dp array of size n+1 where n is the length of s. dp[i] = true if s[0..i-1] can be segmented into dictionary words. Set dp[0] = true (empty string can be segmented). For each position i from 1 to n, for each word in wordDict: if the word matches the suffix of s[0..i-1] (i.e., s[i-word.length..i-1] == word) and dp[i-word.length] is true, then dp[i] = true. The answer is dp[n]. Time complexity is O(n * m * L) where n is the length of s, m is the number of words, and L is the average word length, space complexity is O(n).

    explanation:
      "Approach: Use dynamic programming (bottom-up). Create a dp array of size target+1, initialized to 0. Set dp[0] = 1 (one way to make sum 0 - use no numbers). For each amount from 1 to target, for each num in nums: if num <= amount, dp[amount] += dp[amount - num]. The answer is dp[target].

You may return the combinations in any order. The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use backtracking (recursion). Sort the candidates array first (optional but helps with pruning). Define a recursive function that takes: the current index, the remaining target, and the current combination. At each step: 1) If remaining target is 0, add the current combination to the result. 2) If remaining target is negative or index is out of bounds, return. 3) For each candidate from the current index to the end: include the candidate in the combination, recursively call with the same index (allowing reuse) and remaining target minus the candidate, then remove the candidate (backtrack). Time complexity is O(2^(target/min(candidates))) in the worst case, space complexity is O(target/min(candidates)) for the recursion stack. The key insight is that allowing reuse means we stay at the same index when recursing, and sorting helps prune early when candidates exceed the remaining target.",

The only remaining value is the missing number. Time complexity is O(n), space complexity is O(1). Alternative approach: use the sum formula - the sum of numbers from 0 to n is n*(n+1)/2. Subtract the sum of the array elements from this to get the missing number. The key insight is that XOR of a number with itself is 0, so pairing each index with its value cancels out all present numbers.",

    title: "Reverse Bits",
    description: "Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.",
    explanation:
      "Approach: Use bit manipulation. Initialize result = 0. Loop 32 times (for a 32-bit integer): 1) Left shift result by 1 (make room for the next bit). 2) Extract the last bit of n using n & 1. 3) Add this bit to result using result |= (n & 1). 4) Right shift n by 1 (n >>= 1). After 32 iterations, result contains the reversed bits. Time complexity is O(1) since we always loop exactly 32 times, space complexity is O(1). The key insight is that by processing bits from the least significant to the most significant and building the result from the most significant to the least significant, we reverse the bit order.",
