    title: "Apache Kafka Full Course - Introduction & Why Kafka",
    description:
      "Apache Kafka is a DISTRIBUTED EVENT STREAMING platform originally built at LinkedIn (2011). It is designed to handle trillions of events per day with high throughput, low latency, and strong durability. Kafka is used by 80%+ of Fortune 100 companies including Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, LinkedIn, Twitter, Amazon, and Google. WHY KAFKA? Many scenarios need ASYNCHRONOUS event-driven communication: 1) User places order -> send email, update inventory, charge payment - all without blocking. 2) Multiple services need to react to the same event independently. 3) Handle MILLIONS of events per second without losing data. 4) Decouple services so each can scale and fail independently. KEY PROPERTIES: HIGH THROUGHPUT (millions/sec), DURABLE (persisted + replicated, default 3), SCALABLE (add brokers), FAULT-TOLERANT (replication), REPLAYABLE (default 7-day retention), DISTRIBUTED, ORDERED within partition. USE CASES: messaging, activity tracking, metrics/log aggregation, stream processing (Kafka Streams), event sourcing, change data capture (Debezium), IoT telemetry, real-time analytics. Foundation of modern event-driven microservices.",

    title: "Kafka Explained - Real-Time Examples & Use Cases",
    description:
      "Day 2: real-time examples to build intuition. EXAMPLE 1 - E-COMMERCE: WITHOUT Kafka, Order Service synchronously calls Email, Inventory, Payment, Analytics, Recommendation services. If any is slow, user waits. WITH Kafka: Order Service publishes 'OrderPlaced' event and returns immediately. Other services consume independently. EXAMPLE 2 - RIDE SHARING (Uber): Driver location changes 100 times per minute. Driver Service publishes 'LocationUpdated' events. Rider, ETA, Analytics, Surge Pricing services each consume the same stream. EXAMPLE 3 - IOT TELEMETRY: 10,000 sensors sending data every second. Kafka buffers, persists, distributes. EXAMPLE 4 - LOG AGGREGATION: 100 microservices log to Kafka. One consumer indexes for Elasticsearch, another triggers alerts, another feeds data lake. TRADITIONAL QUEUE vs KAFKA: Queues DELETE messages after consumption; Kafka RETAINS messages for configured period (default 7 days) - REPLAY-ABILITY is the killer feature - new consumers can join and read historical events.",

    title: "Kafka Core Components - Producer, Consumer, Broker, Topic",
    description:
      "Day 3: Kafka's architecture. BROKER: a Kafka SERVER that stores messages and serves clients. A Kafka CLUSTER is multiple brokers (typically 3+) working together. TOPIC: a category/feed name for messages (like a table). Example: 'orders', 'user-events'. PARTITION: a topic is split into partitions for parallelism. Each partition is an ORDERED, APPEND-ONLY LOG file on disk. Each message has an OFFSET (sequential 64-bit integer) within its partition. Offsets start at 0 and increment forever. PARTITION KEY: Hash(key) % numPartitions selects the partition. Same key -> same partition -> ordering guaranteed. PRODUCER: client that publishes messages to a topic. Can choose partition or let Kafka decide. CONSUMER: client that reads messages from a topic. Belongs to a CONSUMER GROUP. Multiple consumers in same group share work (load balanced). Different groups get all messages independently (pub-sub). ZOOKEEPER (or KRaft in Kafka 3.x): coordinates brokers, leader election. REPLICATION FACTOR: each partition has copies on multiple brokers (usually 3). One is the leader (handles reads/writes), others are followers.",

    title: "Kafka Installation & Setup - Configuration Files",
    description:
      "Day 4: installing Kafka locally. REQUIREMENTS: Java 8+ (you have it from the Java course). Modern Kafka 3.x uses KRaft mode (no Zookeeper needed) - simpler setup. STEP 1: Download Kafka from kafka.apache.org (kafka_2.13-3.6.0.tgz). Extract to a folder like C:\\kafka. STEP 2: Configure KRaft mode (single-node setup): edit config/kraft/server.properties - set process.roles=broker,controller, node.id=1, controller.quorum.voters=1@localhost:9093, listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092,CONTROLLER://:9093, advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092, log.dirs=/tmp/kraft-combined-logs (Windows: C:\\tmp\\kraft-combined-logs). STEP 3: Format storage (run ONCE): bin/kafka-storage.sh format -t $(bin/kafka-storage.sh random-uuid) -c config/kraft/server.properties. On Windows: bin\\windows\\kafka-storage.bat format -t <uuid> -c config\\kraft\\server.properties. STEP 4: Start Kafka: bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/kraft/server.properties (Windows: bin\\windows\\kafka-server-start.bat). Leave this terminal open - Kafka runs in foreground. KEY FILES: server.properties - broker config (port, log retention, replication). producer.properties - default producer settings. consumer.properties - default consumer settings. log4j.properties - logging. TROUBLESHOOTING: port 9092 conflict -> change listeners in server.properties. log.dirs permission denied -> use writable path. Java not found -> set JAVA_HOME. Verify installation: run kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list - should return empty list without errors.",

    title: "Kafka CLI Live Demo - Producer, Consumer, Topic Commands",
    description:
      "Day 5: hands-on with Kafka command-line tools (available at bin/kafka-topics.sh / kafka-console-producer.sh / kafka-console-consumer.sh or .bat on Windows). TOPIC COMMANDS: CREATE: bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic my-topic --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1. LIST: --list shows all topics. DESCRIBE: --describe --topic my-topic shows partitions, leaders, replicas, isr. ALTER: --alter --topic my-topic --partitions 5 increases partitions (cannot decrease). DELETE: --delete --topic my-topic. PRODUCER CLI (interactive): bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic my-topic. Type messages line by line, Ctrl+C to stop. For key-value messages add --property \"parse.key=true\" --property \"key.separator=,\". CONSUMER CLI: bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic my-topic --from-beginning reads ALL messages from start. Without --from-beginning reads only NEW messages. --group my-group joins a consumer group. Useful flags: --max-messages 10 (read only 10), --timeout-ms 5000 (exit after 5s idle), --property print.timestamp=true (show timestamps), --property print.partition=true (show partition), --property print.key=true (show key). PRACTICAL EXERCISE: open TWO terminals. Terminal 1: start consumer with --from-beginning. Terminal 2: start producer, type messages. Watch them appear in real-time in Terminal 1. Try kill+restart consumer - it resumes from last offset. This is the easiest way to verify Kafka is working and understand the flow.",

    title: "Kafka with Spring Boot - Producer & Consumer Demo",
    description:
      "Day 6: integrate Kafka with Spring Boot - the practical way you'll use it in production. Setup: add spring-kafka dependency to your Spring Boot project. Configure bootstrap servers in application.yml: spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092. spring.kafka.consumer.group-id=my-app-group. spring.kafka.consumer.auto-offset-reset=earliest (read from start for new consumer groups). spring.kafka.consumer.key-deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer. spring.kafka.producer.key-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer. PRODUCER: inject KafkaTemplate: @Autowired private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate; public void sendMessage(String topic, String message) { kafkaTemplate.send(topic, message); } - that's it! Or with key for partitioning: kafkaTemplate.send(topic, key, message). Add @EnableKafka on your config class. CONSUMER: use @KafkaListener annotation - it's magic. @KafkaListener(topics = \"my-topic\", groupId = \"my-app-group\") public void consume(String message) { System.out.println(\"Received: \" + message); // process the message }. The method runs for EVERY incoming message automatically. For JSON objects: @KafkaListener(topics = \"my-topic\") public void consume(MyObject obj) { ... } - Spring auto-deserializes. ERROR HANDLING: configure DefaultErrorHandler with DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer to send failed messages to a DLQ topic after N retries. SCALING: run multiple instances of your consumer app - Kafka automatically distributes partitions across them. This pattern (KafkaTemplate + @KafkaListener) is THE foundation for event-driven microservices in Spring Boot.",
