    title: "API Introduction - What is an API? REST vs SOAP & Why Spring Boot",
    description:
      "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that lets one software application talk to another. Think of it as a waiter in a restaurant - you (the client) give your order to the waiter (the API), who passes it to the kitchen (the server), then brings back your food (the response). REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural STYLE for designing APIs that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and works with JSON or XML. It is STATELESS - each request contains all info needed. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is an older, stricter PROTOCOL that uses XML only, with built-in standards for security and transactions. REST wins today because it is simpler, lighter, more flexible. Why Spring Boot? 1) Auto-configuration. 2) Embedded Tomcat - run as a single JAR. 3) Starter dependencies. 4) Production features (Actuator, metrics, health). 5) Huge ecosystem. 6) Industry standard used by MAANG companies.",

    title: "Spring Boot Annotations - @RestController, @Service, @Repository, @Entity",
    description:
      "Annotations are metadata that tell Spring Boot HOW to treat your classes. They replace hundreds of lines of XML config. KEY ANNOTATIONS: @SpringBootApplication - marks main class. @RestController - marks REST API controller; combines @Controller + @ResponseBody (returns JSON directly). @Controller - returns view templates. @Service - business-logic class. @Repository - data-access class; translates SQL exceptions. @Component - generic stereotype. @Entity - marks class as JPA entity (database table). @Id - primary key. @Autowired - injects dependencies. @Configuration + @Bean - manual bean definition. @GetMapping, @PostMapping - map HTTP methods to handlers. @PathVariable, @RequestParam, @RequestBody - extract data from URL, query, and body. Mastering annotations is the foundation of Spring Boot.",

    title: "Spring Boot Architecture - Request Flow, Annotations & Layers",
    description:
      "Spring Boot follows a layered architecture. Request flow: 1) DispatcherServlet receives request. 2) HandlerMapping identifies which @RestController method handles the URL. 3) Controller method executes, possibly delegating to Service. 4) Service contains business logic, calls Repository methods. 5) Repository talks to database via JPA/Hibernate. 6) Response travels back up as Java object. 7) HttpMessageConverter serializes object to JSON. 8) JSON sent to client. LAYERS: Controller (@RestController) - HTTP handling, request/response. Service (@Service) - business rules, validation, transactions. Repository (@Repository) - database operations. Database Layer - actual tables. Why layered? Single responsibility, easy testing, reusable services, maintainable. The Employee Management System uses exactly this architecture.",

    title: "First REST API - Build, Test with Postman, GET & POST Mapping",
    description:
      "Your first Spring Boot REST API in 5 steps. STEP 1: Create Spring Boot project at start.spring.io with Spring Web dependency. STEP 2: Open in IntelliJ, run the main class - embedded Tomcat starts on port 8080. STEP 3: Create a @RestController class. STEP 4: Add handler methods with @GetMapping and @PostMapping. Spring auto-converts return values to JSON. STEP 5: Test with Postman. Example: @RestController public class HelloController { @GetMapping(\"/hello\") public String hello() { return \"Hello BSK!\"; } @PostMapping(\"/greet\") public String greet(@RequestBody String name) { return \"Hello, \" + name; } }. Testing: GET http://localhost:8080/hello returns 'Hello BSK!'. POST http://localhost:8080/greet with body 'BSK' returns 'Hello, BSK'. JSON responses make APIs language-agnostic - any client (React, mobile, Python) can consume them.",

    description:
      "Day 5 builds a complete Employee Management System. Setup: 1) Dependencies - Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database, Lombok. 2) Define Employee entity: @Entity @Table(name=\"employees\") public class Employee { @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) private Long id; private String name; private String department; private double salary; }. 3) Create EmployeeRepository extending JpaRepository<Employee, Long> - you get findAll(), findById(), save(), deleteById() for FREE. 4) Create EmployeeService with @Service and inject the repository. 5) Create EmployeeController with endpoints: POST /api/employees (create), GET /api/employees (list all), GET /api/employees/{id} (find one). Test with Postman - send JSON body for POST, verify GET returns saved data. JpaRepository's magic: zero SQL, zero JDBC code. This pattern (Entity -> Repository -> Service -> Controller) is used in every Spring Boot project worldwide.",

    description:
      "Day 6 completes CRUD with UPDATE and DELETE. UPDATE - use @PutMapping(\"/{id}\"): find by id, update fields, repo.save() returns updated entity. Spring's save() performs INSERT if id is new, UPDATE if id exists. DELETE - use @DeleteMapping(\"/{id}\"): repo.deleteById(id). @PathVariable extracts id from URL. @RequestBody deserializes JSON body into Java object. Test in Postman: PUT http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1 with updated JSON -> 200 OK with updated object. DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1 -> 200 OK with confirmation. After this day, your Employee API has FULL CRUD - same operations you'd build for users, products, orders. Mastering these four operations is 80% of API development. The remaining 20% is pagination, filtering, sorting, security - all extensions of these basics.",

H2 IN-MEMORY (perfect for development/testing): spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb spring.h2.console.enabled=true spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console. Then visit http://localhost:8080/h2-console to inspect tables visually. MYSQL (for production): add mysql-connector-j dependency, then spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_db with username and password. spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto options: none, validate, update, create (DEV only). To switch databases, only change the URL and driver - your Java code stays the same. This is the magic of JPA abstraction: same EmployeeRepository works against H2 today and MySQL tomorrow.",

    description:
      "Day 8 covers Git basics and pushing your project to GitHub. Git is the industry-standard version control system - it tracks every change, lets multiple developers collaborate, and serves as a backup. Basic workflow: 1) Initialize: git init. 2) Stage changes: git add . (stage all files). 3) Commit: git commit -m 'Initial commit'. 4) Create repo on github.com. 5) Connect: git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/repo.git. 6) Push: git push -u origin main. From now on: git add . -> git commit -m 'message' -> git push. Essential commands: git status (what changed), git log (commit history), git diff (see changes), git branch (list branches), git checkout -b feature (create branch). Always create a .gitignore file to exclude target/, .idea/, *.iml, application-local.properties. NEVER commit passwords or secrets. Use feature branches for new work, merge via pull requests. Git is mandatory for every developer job - practice daily.",

Step 2: Annotate DTO fields: @NotNull, @NotBlank (for strings), @Size(min=2, max=50), @Min(0), @Max(150), @Email, @Pattern(regexp=\"...\"). Step 3: Add @Valid to controller method parameter: public Employee createEmployee(@Valid @RequestBody EmployeeDTO dto). Step 4: When validation fails, Spring throws MethodArgumentNotValidException. For custom exceptions, create a class extending RuntimeException: public class ResourceNotFoundException extends RuntimeException { public ResourceNotFoundException(String msg) { super(msg); } }. Throw it from service: throw new ResourceNotFoundException(\"Employee not found with id: \" + id). This sets up tomorrow's global handler.",

    description:
      "Day 10 introduces GLOBAL exception handling - the cleanest way to handle errors across the entire application. Instead of try-catch in every controller, create ONE central class: @ControllerAdvice public class GlobalExceptionHandler { @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class) public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleNotFound(...) {...} @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class) public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleValidation(...) {...} }. @ControllerAdvice makes the class apply to ALL controllers. @ExceptionHandler binds a method to a specific exception type. Create an ErrorResponse DTO for consistent error structure. Result: every endpoint returns the SAME error format - clients can parse errors uniformly. This is what production APIs look like.",

Built-in annotations (@NotNull, @Email) cover most cases, but sometimes you need custom rules like PAN card format (5 letters + 4 digits + 1 letter) or 10-digit mobile numbers. Three steps: STEP 1: Create the annotation interface with @interface, message(), groups(), payload(). STEP 2: Create the validator class implementing ConstraintValidator<Pan, String> with isValid() returning boolean via regex. STEP 3: Link them via @Constraint(validatedBy = PanValidator.class) on the annotation. Use it: @Pan private String panNumber; Spring runs the validator automatically with @Valid. Same pattern for @Mobile (10-digit, starts with 6-9).",

Then annotate: @Operation(summary=\"Get employee by ID\") @ApiResponses({...}) on controller methods. @Parameter(description=\"Employee ID\") on parameters. @Schema(description=\"Employee model\") on DTO fields. Visit http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html for the interactive UI - test endpoints directly from the browser. Also visit /v3/api-docs for the raw OpenAPI JSON spec. Benefits: frontend team knows what to send, new developers onboard faster, QA can test without Postman, auto-updates when code changes. Swagger is industry standard - every serious API has it.",

Enable endpoints: management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics,env,mappings. /actuator/health returns UP/DOWN (used by load balancers and Kubernetes). /actuator/info shows build info. /actuator/metrics shows JVM, CPU, memory, HTTP request metrics. /actuator/env shows all environment properties. /actuator/loggers lets you change log levels at runtime. CUSTOM ENDPOINTS: create @RestController with @Endpoint(id=\"custom\"). Actuator is what makes Spring Boot 'production-ready' out of the box.

Inject logger: private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(EmployeeService.class); Use it: log.trace/debug/info/warn/error. Levels (lowest to highest): TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR. Set level globally: logging.level.root=INFO, logging.level.com.bsk=DEBUG. Customize with logback-spring.xml: rolling policies (daily files), patterns, separate error logs. Best practices: 1) Never use System.out.println in production. 2) Log meaningful context. 3) Log exceptions with stack traces. 4) Use parameterized logs: log.info(\"Created employee {}\", id).",

    title: "Builder Design Pattern in Spring Boot - Day 15",
    description:
      "Day 15 introduces the Builder Design Pattern - one of the most used patterns in Spring Boot and modern Java. PROBLEM: When a class has many optional fields, constructors explode into all-combination monsters (telescoping constructor anti-pattern). SOLUTION: Builder lets you set fields one at a time, fluently, and only the ones you need. Traditional implementation: public class Employee { private String name; private String dept; private double salary; private String email; // private constructor takes EmployeeBuilder. public static class EmployeeBuilder { private String name; private String dept; private double salary; private String email; public EmployeeBuilder name(String n) { this.name = n; return this; } // setters for each field returning this. public Employee build() { return new Employee(this); } } }. Usage: Employee e = new Employee.EmployeeBuilder().name(\"BSK\").dept(\"IT\").salary(50000).build();. With Lombok, just add @Builder annotation and the pattern is generated automatically. Builders create immutable objects safely and make code very readable. Spring uses builders extensively (e.g. UriComponentsBuilder, MockMvcRequestBuilders).",

Setup: dependencies spring-boot-starter-test (includes JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ). For repository tests, use @DataJpaTest - it loads only JPA-related config, uses H2 in-memory DB by default. Example: @DataJpaTest class EmployeeRepositoryTest { @Autowired private EmployeeRepository repo; @Autowired private TestEntityManager em; @Test void testSaveEmployee() { Employee emp = new Employee(\"BSK\", \"IT\", 50000); Employee saved = em.persistAndFlush(emp); assertThat(saved.getId()).isNotNull(); assertThat(repo.findById(saved.getId())).isPresent(); } @Test void testFindByDepartment() { em.persist(new Employee(\"RAM\", \"HR\", 40000)); em.persist(new Employee(\"RAVI\", \"HR\", 45000)); List<Employee> hr = repo.findByDepartment(\"HR\"); assertThat(hr).hasSize(2); } }.
