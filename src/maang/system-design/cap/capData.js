      "Think of 2 branches of one bank. The phone line between them cuts. A man deposits money in Branch A. Branch B still shows old balance because it cannot ask Branch A. Now you have only 2 choices: (1) close Branch B for some time so nobody sees wrong money, or (2) keep Branch B open but it will show old money for some time. You cannot do both. This is full CAP theorem.",

    code: `// ===== CAP THEOREM - KEY INSIGHTS =====\n//\n// Scenario: 2 nodes (Node A and Node B) with a network partition\n//\n// BEFORE partition (both in sync):\n//   Node A: balance = $1000\n//   Node B: balance = $1000\n//   Status: synced\n//\n// NETWORK PARTITION happens (A cannot talk to B)\n//\n// Client writes $500 to Node A:\n//   Node A: balance = $1500  accepted\n//   Node B: balance = $1000  stale (cannot sync)\n//\n// CP SYSTEM:\n//   Client reads from Node B:\n//     Node B has stale data ($1000 vs real $1500)\n//     CP SYSTEM REFUSES to serve stale data\n//     Returns ERROR / timeout\n//     Consistency preserved, Availability lost\n//\n// AP SYSTEM:\n//   Client reads from Node B:\n//     Node B serves stale data ($1000)\n//     AP SYSTEM serves it anyway (stays available)\n//     Availability preserved, Consistency lost\n//     Data will sync when partition heals\n\n// ===== REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES =====\n//\n// CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):\n//   - MongoDB (default settings)\n//   - HBase\n//   - Redis\n//   - ZooKeeper\n//   - PostgreSQL (single-primary)\n//   - Banking systems, payment processors\n//   When partition happens, some requests fail\n//\n// AP Systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance):\n//   - Cassandra\n//   - DynamoDB (default)\n//   - CouchDB\n//   - Riak\n//   - Social media feeds, like counters\n//   System stays up, may serve stale data briefly\n\n// ===== QUICK DECISION GUIDE =====\n//\n// Choose CP when:\n//   - Data correctness is critical (money, orders, inventory)\n//   - Stale data would cause real problems\n//   - You can afford some downtime during partitions\n//\n// Choose AP when:\n//   - System availability is more important than instant consistency\n//   - Brief staleness is acceptable (feeds, likes, comments)\n//   - Your app must stay up no matter what\n`,
